## How To Run The Sample Project

The project was run using Visual Studio 2019 which can be found here https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ and installed using default choices for all installation specifications. The project was written in C# latest (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7029) using .NET v3.0 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).

Then after all of the necessary libraries are installed go to visual studio 2019. You can either clone the repo directly with git and the command line, or clone using visual studio. Once it's cloned and you're inside the project simply run the green run button that says the name of the app (ConsoleApp1). It should output the results. 

**Note:** this project uses the provided ridelog.dat file for data. This file has been placed in the folder ```ConsoleApp1/ConsoleApp1/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1``` relative to the project root.
